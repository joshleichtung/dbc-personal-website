      <h2>Origin Story</h2>
      <p>I found my dog Mascis when he was only 3 months old. He was eating the
      crumbs out of a bag of chips in a gutter. We picked him up and tried to find
      his owner around the neighborhood. Eventually, we were introduced to a man
      named Icewater, who was Mascis's owner.</p>
      <p>Due to circumstances beyond his control, Icewater was unable to care for
      Mascis, and offered to sell him to us if we took good care of him. A deal was
      struck, and Mascis came home for a bath, an life necessity that hte
      <b>hates</b> to this day.</p>
      <p>Mascis is named after shaggy-haired, bearded guitar player named <a

      <h2>Thoughts on other dog sites</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.barkleysc.com/">Sir Charles Barkeley the French
        Bull Dog</a> Has a website with an ok layout, but a lot of problems. It
      has a javascript function that disables right clicking and brining up the
      contextual menu. This is annoying. I like the navigation and slim style,
      but on the whole, am not in love with antything about the site. It did use
      some semantic markup for footers, but that's about it. It can be
      hard to find a dog with good design and coding skills.
